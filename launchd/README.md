# launchd templates — serve the GitHub Actions pool at boot

These are LaunchAgent templates that run the per-job ephemeral runner supervisors
(`providers/tart-linux/runner.sh`, `providers/qemu-windows/runner.sh`, and the
macOS provider as it graduates from the Pulp script) under
`launchd` so a host serves the pool across reboots. They are the persistent
counterpart of `tartci serve <os> --loop`.

## Generic toolkit vs. Pulp's concrete instance

The **runner scripts are project-agnostic** — repo, golden, labels, and the
"is there queued work?" workflow name are all env-driven
(`TARTCI_RUNNER_REPO`, `TARTCI_LINUX_GOLDEN` / `TARTCI_MACOS_GOLDEN` /
`TARTCI_WIN_GOLDEN`, `TARTCI_RUNNER_LABELS`, `TARTCI_RUNNER_WORKFLOW_NAME`).

The **templates here are Pulp's concrete instance** — the first consumer.
Their `Label`s are `com.danielraffel.pulp.tart-runner`,
`com.danielraffel.pulp.tart-runner-linux`, and
`com.danielraffel.pulp.qemu-runner-windows` because the
[shipyard-macos-gui](https://github.com/danielraffel/shipyard-macos-gui) "Serve
CI builds from this Mac" switch hard-codes those labels (its
`CIServingLane.known`) to `launchctl load/unload` them. Keep the labels exactly
as-is when serving Pulp.

## macOS launchd rule

The macOS lane must not point launchd at a `/Volumes` checkout or VM store. On
2026-06-09 the Studio proof showed the existing Pulp plist crash-looping with
exit 126 because launchd could not `getcwd` under `/Volumes/Workshop/Code/pulp`
or read `/Volumes/Workshop/Code/pulp/tools/ci/tart-runner.sh`. The green proof
used `WorkingDirectory=$HOME`, a wrapper under `$HOME/.local/bin`, and
`TART_HOME=$HOME/VMs`; launchd booted a macOS clone and exited 0.

Use `com.danielraffel.pulp.tart-runner-macos.plist.template` as the replacement
shape: install tartci into `$HOME/.local/share/tartci`, expose a small
`$HOME/.local/bin/tartci` wrapper, and keep macOS goldens under `$HOME/VMs`.
Only use `/Volumes` for macOS launchd after introducing a signed Full Disk
Access helper.
Shipyard fleet probes should point `host_class.<name>.tartci_bin` at that same
wrapper and `host_class.<name>.tart_home` at the same `$HOME/VMs` store; otherwise
capacity and supervisor health will be read from different Tart homes.

If a host already has a required-lane Pulp LaunchAgent using
`com.danielraffel.pulp.tart-runner`, do not overwrite it during pilot. Install a
side-by-side pilot plist with a distinct `Label`, log path, and non-required
runner labels, then load it only after `shipyard runner capacity` shows a free
slot. Graduate labels later, after the required lane drains and rollback is
ready.

## Janitor

`com.danielraffel.tartci.reap.plist.template` runs the Phase-4 Tier-2 janitor:

```sh
tartci doctor --reap --json --fix
```

It is safe-by-construction rather than denylist-only. VM deletion requires both
an allowed CI prefix (`pulp-vm-`/`tartci-` by default) and a tartci state-file
ownership marker. Goldens, `pulp-vm`, `rosetta-probe`, and bench names remain
protected. Offline GitHub runner registrations are removed only when they match
an owned CI prefix and no fresh live supervisor heartbeat backs them. Run it
report-only first:

```sh
TART_HOME="$HOME/VMs" "$HOME/.local/bin/tartci" doctor --reap --json
```

Then install the LaunchAgent once the report is clean. Logs land in
`~/Library/Logs/tartci/tartci-reap.log`.

## Serving a different repo

1. Copy a template to `com.<you>.<repo>.<provider>.plist.template`.
2. Change the `<Label>` and the `--labels` argument to your repo's runner labels.
3. Point `TARTCI_RUNNER_REPO` (and golden/labels) at your repo via the plist's
   `EnvironmentVariables` or the `runner.sh` env defaults.
4. If you drive it from the Shipyard macOS GUI, add a matching row to that app's
   `CIServingLane.known` with your new label.

## Install (Pulp)

See the header comment in each `.plist.template` for the exact `sed` install
recipe (launchd does **not** expand `$HOME`/`$TARTCI_REPO` — the install `sed`
must write absolute paths). Logs land in `~/Library/Logs/tartci/`.
